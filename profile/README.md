## About AppCleaner for Mac

**AppCleaner for Mac** is a lightweight yet incredibly powerful application designed to completely remove unwanted programs from your macOS system. Developed by **FreeMacSoft**, this tool ensures that when you delete an app, every related file — including caches, logs, settings, and hidden support folders — is removed entirely from your system. It’s not just a simple uninstaller; it’s a full-scale **Mac cleanup utility** that maintains system hygiene and optimizes performance with every use.

Unlike the traditional drag-and-drop method of deleting apps, which leaves behind numerous traces in your **Library** and **Application Support** folders, **AppCleaner Mac** performs a deep and intelligent scan to locate all associated files. With just one click, it allows you to completely erase applications, helping free up storage space, prevent file clutter, and keep your macOS environment clean and fast.

The app is fully compatible with modern **macOS** versions — including **macOS Ventura**, **Sonoma**, and **Monterey** — and supports both **Intel** and **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)** architectures.
